Machine Learning Prediction using Time Series Models

Power consumption has grown due to population growth, lifestyle changes, and technological advancements. This increases the use of renewable resources while simultaneously raising energy prices. Also, as a result of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in power use, which has raised the price of electricity. With technological improvements, it is now feasible to reduce power use using machine learning approaches. Time series is an important aspect in machine learning, and it is employed in a variety of areas, including healthcare, finance, and business. Time series models provide for forecasts and control over power use. As univariate data, a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was selected, which had a feature called active power in kW. Data preparation was undertaken since the data comprised huge amounts of missing, inconsistent data; also, exploratory data analysis was performed to better comprehend the data. The prediction job was carried out using the Statistical and Classical Model (ARIMA), the Decision Tree Model (XGBoost), and the Deep Learning Model (LSTM). Each model had different findings. Since this investigation was conducted across four years, long-term dependencies were addressed, demonstrating that LSTM outperformed alternative models such as XGBoost and ARIMA. ARIMA, on the other hand, works well with short-term dependencies. This study explores several time series prediction models.
